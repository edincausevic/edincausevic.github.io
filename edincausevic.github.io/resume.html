						<h3>A bit about me</h3>		
						<p>My first contact with web design was three years ago, when I have started to change the content of the web pages. Code that was holding that content for me was something alien. From beginning I would start to understand the more simple stuff like paragraph, body, head...Soon after that, I felt curiosity to learn the rest of the code that I was looking. What in that time was pure HTML and CSS. After taking my first online course on web design, I felt the wish to continue with that. Today, after three years working in that field, I gained knowledge of Front End Web Developer. But my education doesn't stop there! Almost every day I would take few hours to learn something new or to repeat what I already know. I noticed that it doesn't tire me and that I'm enjoying working as a web designer. My goal is to stay on this path and to gain a lot of more knowledge in that field.</p>

						<h3>Internet Cafe Owner</h3>	
						<p class="godine-rada">2007-2008</p>
						<p>As an owner of a Internet Cafe I had the opportunity to learn a lot about computers but also about leadership and teamwork. That was my first small steps toward what I am now. The job was requiring a lot responsibility and hard work. That was my first real experience and not only as owner yet as one of the workers interacting with the people and the conduct of business.</p>
						<h3 class="marg-up">Petrol Station Manager</h3>	
						<p class="godine-rada">2010-2011</p>
						<p>After I started to work as a gas station manager, a way of looking at leadership as well as interaction with my workers and the clientele was quite improved. I led the team with three man per shift. My responsibility was huge because I had wondered about everything. From maintaining books for fuel and sales to receiving customers and solving problems within the work. This job really changed me and gave me a broader framework of reality both at work and in private life.</p>
						<h3 class="marg-up">Wersa Studio</h3>	
						<p class="godine-rada">2011-2014</p>
						<p>Wersa Studio is my first small business. More specifically it was a web page where I affering photo restoration and black and white photo coloring services. That was also one of my first web pages that I did with my brother. The page was a pure CSS and HTML code with some elements of PHP.</p>
						<h3 class="marg-up">Web Developer</h3>	
						<p class="godine-rada">2012-2015</p>
						<p>My first real steps were led over to making sites for some of my projects and the friends who have needed the website. I discover in myself a hidden love for this job and til today I have stayed on that path. Web design is now an essential part of me and that is the direction in which I want to go. If you ask me where I see myself in five years. The answer is clear! I see it as a web designer.</p>
